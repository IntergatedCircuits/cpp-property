# Properties for C++!

This single C++ header gives free (as in no added size) properties to your classes.

Terms and conditions:
- C++20 or higher is needed for no added size, due to using `[[no_unique_address]]`
- `offsetof()` is used under the hood, which has notable limitations depending on your compiler
